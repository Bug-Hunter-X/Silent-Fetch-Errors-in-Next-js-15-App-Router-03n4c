# Silent Fetch Errors in Next.js 15 App Router

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15's App Router related to unhandled fetch errors within asynchronous component functions.  The issue involves the potential for silent failures when a `fetch` call within an `async` function throws an error and the error isn't properly caught and handled.

## Problem Description

When making a fetch request within an async function in a Next.js 15 App Router page, if the request fails (e.g., network error, server error), and the error isn't caught in a `try...catch` block, or if the `try...catch` block is not properly implemented, the application might not provide any indication of the problem. This can make debugging very difficult.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior. The page might initially display correctly but if the API endpoint fails it might not display an error appropriately.

## Solution

The solution focuses on ensuring robust error handling within the `async` function, specifically using a comprehensive `try...catch` block, and potentially adding more specific error handling based on response status codes. The improved solution will handle various scenarios better, ensuring appropriate feedback to the user and facilitating easier debugging.
